Identifying Special Matrices- Assignment submitted for online Machine learning Math course offered by Imperial College London. 
When coding or solving data analysis problems, one problem that can  occur is if the code encounters a special matrix that isn't invertible,  or has an infinite number of eigenvectors, or similar.
So here is a code fragment that traps for different types of special matrices before calling the python inversion routine, and classifies the type of special case encountered.
